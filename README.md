# TonKnows
#### A simple network miner
Very much in ALPHA right now

Python 3

### What is this for?
I have a network with **nodes** connected through **links**. Some of the nodes I know have property **X** and some I
know have property **Y**. But I don't know them all, so can I predict the properties (X, Y, or both) of the unknown nodes?

**TonKnows** is a multilabel multiclass classifier designed to shed some light on the characteristics of your network
using very simple base classifiers to ask understandable questions.
1. Do I have enough data?
2. Do neighboring nodes determine the property of a target node?
3. How do the links contribute to the properties of the nodes?
4. If I'm friend with Merry and also friend with Jason, are Merry and Jason friends to each other?

### Install
* Need a few things:
    1. Python 3.5+
    2. Scikit Learn - which should install numpy, scipy, etc...
    3. Pandas
    4. (for plotting) Seaborn

* No wheels yet, so just download or clone this repository, and we'll go from there

### Usage
##### TL;DR
* To train and save model

    ```./know.py -v --td where/you/have/network.tsv --save```

* To use trained model to evaluate another network

    ```./know.py -v --mod models/model.pkl --ed where/you/have/network2.tsv```

* To use trained model to predict/evaluate another network with unknown nodes

    ```.know.py -v --mod models/model.pkl --pd where/you/have/network3.tsv```

##### Let's first familiarize ourselves with where things are.
* Open a **terminal** and navigate to the ``cd where/you/put/tonknows/`` folder. You should see a ``know.py`` file. That file runs everything.
Please keep it there. Now try this:

    ```python3 know.py --help```

    Now you should see an awful list of possible **options** to use. At this point, you probably also noticed a bunch
    of folders suddenly got created under ``tonknows/``: ``model/``, ``test/``, ``tmp/``.
    They will be used to store many things automatically generated by **TonKnows**.

##### Nows let's create, train, and evaluate some test networks.
* Enter this into the terminal while you are still in the ``tonknows/`` folder:

    ```./know.py --test```
    
    Doing this creates 2 networks:
    1. Pure network ``test/pure_network.tsv``
    1. Mixed network ``test/mix_network.tsv``
    
* Lets try training on these networks. First, the pure network. Enter:
    
    ```./know.py -v --td test/pure_network.tsv```
    
    By default, TonKnows will iterates through the entire dataset 3 times with a 10-fold CV each time. This not only
    helps evaluate the base classifier performances but also is necessary to train the final ensemble classifier and
    a few other cutoff values. Basically use ``--td`` to train a network and, also, a bunch of text will scroll through
    since the ``-v`` verbose flag is used.
    
    You should see from each othe the **performance blocks** that AUC-ROC, F1, precision, recall are pretty much
    perfect. You will never get this unless there are **leaks** in the data or if it is a **pure network** such as this
    one, where each label is only associated to a subnetwork that is not mixed with another label's network.
    
* Let's try something more interesting, and let's use the mixed network:
    
    ```.know.py -v --td test/mix_network.tsv --save```
    
    This network would result in as high of a performance as the pure network, because about 40% of the labels are
    associated to random nodes. Thus it becomes very challenging to determine any real relationships.
    
    This time the model is saved with the ``--save`` flag.
